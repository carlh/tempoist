# The Tempoist

This app is mostly a sandbox for me to play around with SwiftUI design and animation while still building something marginally useful (this might end up being a metronome).

Most metronomes, delay pedals, tremelo pedals, and the like have a feature called "Tap Tempo". This lets you interactively set the device's BPM by tapping, usually by pressing a footswitch repeatedly. In this case, you set the tempo by tapping on a button on the screen.
