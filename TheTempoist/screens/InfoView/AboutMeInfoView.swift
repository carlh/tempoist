Like a lot of guitar players, I've never been very good about practicing along with a metronome.  I know there are a bunch of really good metronome apps already on the app store (and I have more than one installed on my phone), but I'm hoping that since I actually built this one, maybe I'll actually use it ðŸ¤£.  I really hope that you find this simple metronome useful too, and I truly appreciate that you downloaded it.")

I'd be really happy if you report any bugs on the Issues page, and I'll do my best to fix them.  You're also welcome to make feature requests, but to be honest I'm not sure how many new features I'll be adding.  I guess we'll wait and see!" )
